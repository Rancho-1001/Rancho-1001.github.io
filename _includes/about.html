          <p>
            I'm a software engineer who thrives on building
            <strong>reliable, scalable systems</strong> that handle real-world production traffic.
            My journey in tech started with a curiosity about how things work under the hood
            and evolved into a passion for infrastructure, distributed computing, and platform engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            At <strong>Michigan State University</strong>, I'm pursuing Computer Science with a
            minor in Business, earning <strong>Dean's List</strong> honors along the way.
            My coursework spans algorithms, machine learning, operating systems, computer
            security, and networks &mdash; giving me a strong systems foundation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through internships and independent projects, I've designed distributed job processing
            systems handling <strong>10K+ concurrent tasks</strong>, built CI/CD pipelines that deploy
            in under 5 minutes, and architected microservices that cut response latency by 45%.
            I also volunteer as an instructor at <strong>Girls Who Code</strong>, mentoring aspiring
            developers in East Lansing.
